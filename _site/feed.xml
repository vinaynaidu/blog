        <title>Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Continuous integration for .Net projects</title>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt;Continuous integration&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post details the steps required to setup Jenkins to download a .Net project from github, build, run tests using Gallio MbUnit, create build artifacts and aggregate results. When I started out with the task at HealthUnlocked, there were plenty articles about jenkins, and github, and .Net, but no comprehensive articles that detailed how to combine all these together.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this blog, I&amp;#39;ve recorded the pitfalls of setting up the server, common errors that I faced, workarounds, and tips and tricks to make it all nice and shiny - and ultimately more useful, in the hopes that it will be useful to me in the future, or anyone else looking for the same things.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setup required software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming the server is a clean slate server running just the OS, I&amp;#39;ve listed the softwares that need to be installed. If something is already available, it can be skipped, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; - The workhorse that is a continuous integration server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://java.com/en/download/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; - Jenkins relies on a JVM behind the scenes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualstudio.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Visual studio&lt;/a&gt; - VS is not strictly necessary, however .Net Framework is. But Once you have a framework, there are plenty configurations and settings you will need to tweak and installing an express edition of VS will take care of most of that and leave your hands free to work on other things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://git-scm.com/downloads&quot;&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; - Since we&amp;#39;ll be pulling our source code from github, we&amp;#39;ll need git commands to be available on the environment variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all the required softwares are installed, we&amp;#39;re well on our way to start configuring the job. Jenkins, after installation, makes itself available on the port 8080 so it can be accessed by pointing the browser to &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8080/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Codegolf session - part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt;Conway&amp;#39;s game of life&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conway&amp;#39;s game of life is another simple idea that I had a lot of fun coding. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; puts it, it&amp;#39;s a simple cellular automation based on 4 rules:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the simplest of terms, Conways game of life can be seen as a 2x2 matrix with binary values, representing the state of the cell, viz dead or alive. With each iteration, the new value of each row-col position of the matrix is recalculated with the above rules in mind. And, since I already had some experience with paper.js, and, because the best way to represent this would be visually, instead of just printing out matrix states, I went ahead with the javascript route.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the code was up and running, I had a few more minutes to spare, so I added in a &amp;quot;heatmap&amp;quot;, of sorts, to the game. The cell starts off with a green state, and the longer it lives, the close to red it gets. First generation is green and upto 5 different colours of the heatmap, the cell goes from green to yellow to orange to red. This way, I could see which cells are continuing on to next generation easily.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how it looks, once it&amp;#39;s all done: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/game-of-life-short.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The live example of my game of life &lt;a href=&quot;http://vinaynaidu.github.io/projects/codegolf/game-of-life/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Codegolf session - part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt;The idea behind codegolf&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in startups can be great for so many reasons. You spend most of your time with a small group of people you trust, and you have a kind of freedom that working in a big corporations don&amp;#39;t seem to offer. Working becomes fun, when the people you work with are wonderful and understanding.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://healthunlocked.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HealthUnlocked&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes we have the luxury of being able to spend some time away from work - a couple of hours, nothing significant. We come together with the most simplest of ideas, and each developer takes that simple idea and make something out of it. Here, I detail those sessions and what came of it  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;FizzBuzz&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our first idea, we came up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FizzBuzz&lt;/a&gt;  - an extremely simple idea. You print N numbers, and every time the number is divisible by 3, it&amp;#39;s replaced with Fizz. Every time it&amp;#39;s divisible by 5, Buzz is printed of the number. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you print FizzBuzz. The whole code can be simply summed up in javascript in a few lines:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;FizzBuzz&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;        
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Buzz&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Fizz&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simplicity of the code is exactly what makes it an interesting idea. There are so many posibilities that could come out of it. Of course, just doing exactly what I did above with javascript, while tecnically correct, would be too easy and boring, so I wanted to get a bit creative with it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been playing around with &lt;a href=&quot;http://paperjs.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper.js&lt;/a&gt; for a while and when I was told we&amp;#39;d be having a fizzbuzz codegolf, I started thinking of ways to code something fun using paper.js. Here&amp;#39;s what I finally ended up doing. Take a picture - any picture. Analyze the picture pixel by pixel, and calculate how close to being black the pixel is. AKA how much &amp;quot;black&amp;quot; is in the pixel. A pixel with &lt;code&gt;#000&lt;/code&gt; would have a 100% blackness factor, while &lt;code&gt;#fff&lt;/code&gt; would have 0%. Do you see what I am getting at, yet? So I take each pixel, put make it blue if it&amp;#39;s divisible by 3, red if it&amp;#39;s divisible by 5, and purple if divisible by both 3 and 5. This turned out to be a very bad idea - more because I chose a really large picture of monalisa to process, initially. After some trial and error, I ended up resizing the image within the canvas and grouping a set of pixels. Take a group of 10x10 pixels, calculate the collective blackness factor in the group and apply the same logic.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final code, and the image, can be &lt;a href=&quot;http://vinaynaidu.github.io/projects/codegolf/fizzbuzz/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;viewed here&lt;/a&gt;. The page is best viewed at some distance. The size of the rendered circles are proportional to the blackness factor. The darker the pixels are, the larger they are drawn. Even so, the page has to be viewed at least at arm&amp;#39;s legth to see the monalisa behind all the circles!&lt;/p&gt;
